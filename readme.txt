Facilitates the collection and validation of EU VAT numbers on the Easy Digital Downloads checkout page.

== Description ==

The VAT Number for Easy Digital Downloads plugin facilitates collection of customers' VAT numbers by adding a VAT Number field to the Easy Digital Downloads checkout page when the customer's billing address is in the EU. Entered VAT numbers are validated using the European Commission's free VIES web service. The entered VAT number can be viewed in the payment history (along with validation results), and it can also be added to the purchase receipt sent to the customer via email.

Once the plugin is installed, you will need to enable its functionality under (WordPress admin sidebar) Downloads > Settings > Taxes > VAT Number.

This plugin makes calls to an external web service ([VIES](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/)) to perform VAT number validation: http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/checkVatService.wsdl. No registration or API key is required. Use of this plugin in conjunction with the VIES service is subject to the [VIES service disclaimer](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/disclaimer.html).

IMPORTANT: The scope of this plugin is limited and no representation is made in regard to its suitability or sufficiency in meeting the legal requirements associated with the EU VAT. It is entirely your responsibility to ensure that you are meeting all applicable VAT regulations.
